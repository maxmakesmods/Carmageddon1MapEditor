# Carmageddon 1 Map Editor

This is a Work in Progress project for creating a level editor for the game Carmageddon 1 from 1997. It is written in C# and uses Monogame as the base framework.

Note that this is in very early stage of development.

#### Watch me write the code in this repository!

You can watch me write this code on Patreon! In my [Carmageddon1 Map Editor Devlog](https://www.patreon.com/collection/1884819) I document the making of this project from scratch. Every line of code that goes into this repo is documented in these videos. You can follow me for the entire dev cycle from setting up the dev tools to (hopefully eventually) final release of the finished tool. With every video I publish I also publish the code changes in this github repository. One commit per video, so you can easily follow along.
